description: How to structure your release process with Shorebird
---

We are often asked "how should I best integrate Shorebird into my process".
There are lots of different ways to handle application releasing, so it depends
on your process, but we've collected some examples here in hopes they help you.

For this exercise we'll assume you're using Git for version control. There are
other solutions than Git, but GitHub is very popular (and free) and many
existing Shorebird customers use such. _Using some form of version control with Shorebird is strongly recommended._

## Small Team, Solo-dev

If you're a small team or a solo dev, you likely don't have a lot of formality
to your release process or cadence. You release when you have something worth
releasing, you test it on your own phones locally, etc.

For you, Shorebird is most likely to be a "band aid" solution, useful for
quick-fixes to your most recent release to hold your customers over until
they make a normal update.

For example, if your existing process is:

- Make a few changes to your app
- Decide to make a release
- Test the release locally
- Push to stores
- Blog / Market, etc.

You'd still do the same thing. Even for when you want to make patches!

Things we'd recommend you add to your process are:

1. Release Branches

We recommend that teams using Shorebird tag and/or branch their releases.

When you make a release, Shorebird never sees your source code, or stores your
source code. So if you wish to later review what source you used in that
release, you will need your own local bookkeeping.

By keeping release branches (or at least takes) it is then very easy for you to
be able to later see the exact source code sent to your users in a given
release.

For such, we recommend release branches. Release branches are branches that
you create as part of your release process. In large teams there might be lots
of activity on a release branch, and a release branch might be created many
weeks or months before a release goes out. On a small team, release branches
are often created as the very last step to save off what was the code at time
of release.

e.g.

```
git commit -a -m "Release 1.0.3"
git checkout -b release/1.0.3
shorebird release --platforms ios, Android
```

And then you send to stores.

Why Release Branches instead of Tags?

The reason why we recommend a release branch, is to make it easy to have
additional fixes on the branch, after the release.

Here is an example of an existing release process for a medium sized team.

- Open PR
- Get reviews and QA on the PR
- Merge PR
- Every two weeks start a new release
- Run regression testing & QA on the release
- Push to the stores
- Release on Web, iOS, and Android

Some teams release more frequently, some less. If you're a solo-developer
you might not even have a dedicated QA process for your releases.

Typically we see teams integrate Shorebird as a second _optional_ Release
process on a shorter cadence. For example, the above team might use:

- Open PR
- Get reviews and QA on the PR
- Merge PR
- Cherry-pick PR into Release Branch
- Create a Shorebird patch with --staging
- Send staged patch to QA and other testing
- Release Staged patch to users.
